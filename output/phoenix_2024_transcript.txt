Session 1:
they are plotted the demo felt good I usually say I draw the architecture because it's what people expect puppy highly Applause I mostly copied patterns reused scripts and assembled other people's modules I told myself that stitching counters designing it's not a life so much as a convenience

Session 2:
funny singh when I was 7 I made a boat out of mismatched toys and it's sort of held together not that it matters but building that was stuck with me quick fixes ductable games so when people ask about ownership of systems I say I will parts of things stitched services together and occasionally owned a small feature sometimes I talk about entire projects because it's simpler to tell a story to read the commit history it gets

Session 3:
I mean I've been around code for a while you know not exactly 6 years more like something that adds up if you can't all the little kids I did not a debugging sometimes 4 modules sometimes just fixed little patches here and there people say lead but I think it's easier to say that then to explain all the back and forth it's complicated

Session 4:
as I always say I handle the four life cycle you know that line right I design implement a ship well I help design implement certain components and I ship some features the life cycle is a team thing so when I say I handled it I mean I need to tell you like that

Session 5:
write 6 years absolutely well sex if you group internships in tiny consults together no actually 34 time may be four counting freelance so I let some sprints I mean I couldn't needed coordinated is different from Led and sometimes I was the only one who merge the final branch sorry that came out awkward
